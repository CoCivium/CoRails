# BPOE-0006 — NoHereStringsInChatDO: avoid copy/paste footguns

## Rule
In ChatGPT DO blocks, avoid PowerShell here-strings (@'...'@ or @"... "@) because they frequently break copy/paste and can swallow subsequent commands.

## Preferred patterns
- Write files using @() line arrays + Set-Content
- Or use single-line Set-Content with explicit escaping

## If unavoidable
- Only single-quoted here-strings (@'...'@)
- Never nest here-strings
- Never include markdown fences in PowerShell prompts/examples

## Intent
Reduce “block leakage into dialogue” and hard-fail paste errors.
