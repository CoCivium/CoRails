# BPOE-0002 — Chat is not the ledger; SideNotes are micro-# only

## Rule
Do not store operational records in chat. Canon lives in repo/vault with receipts.

## SideNotes format
If a SideNote must be posted for PS7 CoPong, it MUST be a single line starting with '#'.
Everything longer becomes a file in CoRails (or vault) and is referenced by path + SHA.

## Enforcement
- Prefer writing/committing artifacts over pasting large text into chat.
- Treat long “self-notes” in chat as a failure mode (DOM bloat + user distrust + drift risk).
