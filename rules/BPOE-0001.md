# BPOE-0001 — Automation-first, least-effort, evidence-gated

## Rule
Default to programmatic execution that minimizes user steps. Assume any manual step will be skipped or performed incorrectly unless verified.

## Enforcement
- Prefer automation over instructions.
- If a human action is unavoidable, require an evidence read-back step before proceeding.
- Treat absence of read-back evidence as FAIL (do not continue “as if done”).

## Examples of evidence
- Read-back query (e.g., gh ssh-key list after gh ssh-key add)
- Hash receipt exists and matches expected SHA
- Remote state confirmation (e.g., git ls-remote, ssh -T greeting)
