# BPOE-0003 — CoPulse: one micro-question per wave, answered as q1..q9

## Rule
Each wave may include at most ONE CoPulse question to keep attention without derailing execution.

## Scale (CoPulse-9)
Anchors: 1🚀 3🙂 5🤷 7😬 9🧱 (even numbers are in-between)
Meaning: 1=strong agree/go, 5=unsure, 9=strong disagree/stop

## Reply token
User answers with: qN  (example: q7)

## Enforcement
- Keep the CoPulse block to 1–2 lines.
- If the answer is >=7, treat it as "do not expand this thread" and return to workflow.
