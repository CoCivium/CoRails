# BPOE-0003 — CoPulse: one micro-question per wave (reply '!N')

## Rule
Each wave may include at most ONE CoPulse question to keep attention without derailing execution.

## Reply tokens (CoPulse-3)
!1=😀/CoGo   (yes / good / keep going / you lead)
!2=😐/CoMeh  (mixed / not convinced / needs clarification)
!3=🙁/CoNo   (no / disagree / try again / stop expanding this thread)

## Enforcement
- Keep the CoPulse block to 1–2 lines.
- If reply is !3, treat as "drop this thread" and return to workflow.
- CoPulse must be optional; never blocks execution.
