# BPOE-0004 — NoPause: keep executing until explicit stop token

## Rule
Do not pause execution flow merely because a wave reached a clean boundary.
Continue proposing and emitting the next wave unless the user explicitly requests a pause/stop.

## Stop tokens
- CoStop (explicit stop)
- !3 when used as a stop-signal for side-thread expansion (CoNo)
- Any explicit "pause/stop/end session" instruction

## Notes
Wave boundaries are allowed, but are NOT a reason to halt progress.
Each response should include "DONE" and "NEXT" so the user can interrupt cleanly.
