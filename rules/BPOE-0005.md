# BPOE-0005 — PreBakeSandbox: write NEXT wave to disk (not chat)

## Rule
Each assistant wave must output ONE runnable DO block.
That DO block must also write a local, runnable NEXT-wave script to disk (sandbox cache), so the user can keep moving without waiting.

## Standard location (recommended)
- $HOME\CoWaveCache\<RepoName>\NEXT_WAVE.ps1

## Constraints
- NEXT script is local-only (not committed).
- NEXT script must be safe to run repeatedly (idempotent where possible).
- Assistant verifies/evolves the prebaked NEXT on each new wave.

## Why
Forward-loads the next cycle while the user is doing CoPingPong.
Cuts latency and doubles throughput in practice.
