# BPOE-0005 — PreBakeNext: ship NEXT runnable steps to reduce CoPong wait

## Rule
Each assistant response must include:
- DONE: what is verified complete
- NEXT: at least one runnable next-step (or branch set) that does not require waiting for another reply

## Branching (recommended)
Provide small if/else options using clear tokens:
- IF_GREEN / IF_RED
- IF_FOUND / IF_MISSING
so the user can proceed without stalling.

## Non-goals
This is not “two waves in one wave”.
It is one wave that *pre-bakes the next wave’s runnable queue*.
