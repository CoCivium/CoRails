# BPOE-0008 — AckInboundArtifacts: never “drop” uploaded zips/files

## Rule
If the user provides or uploads an artifact (zip/file/link), the next assistant wave must ACK it explicitly:
- Artifact name (and version if present)
- One-line state: IN_FLOW / QUEUED / ACTIONED
- One-line NEXT action (what will be done with it)

## Notes
- ACK is required even if the artifact will be processed in later waves.
- ACK must not derail execution (see BPOE-0004 NoPause).
