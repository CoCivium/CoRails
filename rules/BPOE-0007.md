# BPOE-0007 — CoGuardHeartbeat: show rail-state every wave

## Rule
Each wave must output a single-line CoGuard status:
- CoGuard=GREEN  (determinism OK; no local drift; CI OK or queued)
- CoGuard=YELLOW (non-blocking warnings; investigation suggested)
- CoGuard=RED    (blocking: local drift after rebuild, CI failing, missing ledger/rules, unsafe paste hazard)

## Minimal checks (recommended)
1) Run deterministic rebuild script.
2) Confirm git status clean afterward (no drift).
3) Confirm CI exists for HEAD and is not failing.

## Stop behavior
- If CoGuard=RED: do not expand side threads; fix rails first.
- Only stop execution on explicit stop tokens (BPOE-0004).
